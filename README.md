# cmpt353-project

The final project for CMPT353.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Premise:    If I was planning a tour of the city (by walking/biking/driving), where should I go? 
            Are there paths that take me past an interesting variety of things?

run "spark-submit get_interesting_things.py provided/amenities-vancouver.json.gz" to acquire the vancouver-interesting-things.csv file
run "python3 get_paths_to_interesting_things.py" to get the paths.csv file which contains recommended paths to visit different locations
